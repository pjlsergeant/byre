# Changes

## v0.1.2 -- 2026-07-07

Shared agent logins, and a rebuilt README.

- **Log in once per machine, not once per project** (opt-in): enable
  `claude-shared-auth`, `codex-shared-auth`, or `gemini-shared-auth`
  alongside your agent and one login covers every byre project on the
  machine. byre still reads and copies nothing from your host --
  the credential lives in a shared Docker volume that `byre reset` /
  `byre forget` deliberately never touch (they tell you so, and how to
  delete it on purpose). Gemini note: the API-key path is verified;
  OAuth sharing is still gated (see the skill's description).
- If a box adopting the shared Claude login already had its own
  `/login`, the leftover credential quietly shadows the shared token
  and the box starts failing with 401s about 8h later (Claude prefers
  the stored login and stops refreshing it -- while claiming env-token
  auth). byre now warns at launch when it sees the combination and
  names the one-command fix.
- New `[[volumes]]` grammar: `scope = "machine"` -- one volume per user
  per machine, shared by every project that declares it.
- Skills can carry a one-line `description`, shown in the `byre config`
  skills screen so similar names are tellable apart.
- The `byre config` skills screen now shows INHERITED skills (enabled by
  `default.config` or the template) as on, marked "(inherited)" -- they
  used to render unchecked, which read as off. Toggling one writes the
  cascade's `!name` off-switch into the project layer, and the form's
  skill count now reports the same effective state the checkboxes show.
- Gemini fixes: logins now survive rebuilds (gemini encrypts its
  credential against the hostname; byre boxes now have a stable one),
  and the untrusted-folder and 256-color warnings are gone.
- `byre-codereview` now works in non-git folders.
- New `docs/SECURITY.md`: the security model, stated plainly.
- README rewritten post-release: honest contract renamed to "What's
  boxed, what isn't", toolkit section rebuilt, Homebrew line added
  (the tap itself may lag the release).

## v0.1.1 -- 2026-07-06

First version to actually ship: v0.1.0's release run was (correctly)
refused by the CI gate.

- Fix two seed tests that assumed a real `~/.claude` on the test host.

## v0.1.0 -- 2026-07-06

First public release.
